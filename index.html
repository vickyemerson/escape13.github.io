					Throughout my first two years in university,
					I was working in the <a href="https://rauscher-group.physics.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank"
					>computational biophysics
					lab</a> led by Dr. Sarah Rauscher, where I participated in two projects:
					<br><br>
					1. An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20571" target="_blank">X-Ray crystallography experiment</a> that applied an
					electric field to a protein crystal was conducted 
					by Hekstra et al. to provide a new method of studying 
					protein function. The lab recreated that experiment <a href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(19)33711-7" target="_blank">in 
					silico</a>, using molecular dynamics - a computer simulation 
					method for analyzing the physical movements of atoms 
					and molecules, and provided extensive sampling. My goal was to understand the dynamics
					of that protein crystal, for which I deployed Markov state models - a statistical
					approach to clustering the protein's conformational ensemble into
					distinct low-energy states and calculating the probability of transition between them.

					2. Dimensionality reduction is a statistical method
					that attempts to find a more compact representation
					of data that preserves its geometry. One of the 
					popular approaches for dimensionality reduction is autoencoders - 
					feed-forward neural networks that become narrow in the middle and
					then expand again. By defining the loss function as the error
					of data reconstruction and training the network, we attempt
					to produce data of reduced dimension in the latent space - the bottleneck in the middle.
					Hernández et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08576" target="_blank">adapted this idea</a> for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations.
					<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eZEZW900nRzx1ER5JEky23MYygDEftJw/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">We verified</a> their architecture on several simple proteins and a PDZ domain.
					Additionally, we augmented the architecture of the Variational Dynamics Encoder with an Equivariant Graph Neural Network.

					The following project was completed under the
					supervision of <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/ddauver/" target="_blank">Dr. Duncan Dauvergne</a> in the Department of
					Mathematics in the Summer of 2023.
					<br><br>
					Multi-Particle Diffusion Limited Aggregation (MDLA) is a 
					probabilistic model of infection spread - an "infected"
					particle is placed at the origin of an integer-coordinate grid. 
					At each of the other coordinates, a "healthy" particle is placed
					with probability μ, after which it starts performing a simple random walk.
					When a healthy particle attempts to land on an infected particle,
					it instead becomes infected and freezes in place, causing the growth of the infection cluster.
					In one dimension, this model is very well-studied: Kesten and Sidoravicius 
					<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4175" target="_blank">showed</a> that the growth
					of the infection cluster is almost surely sublinear for 
					any μ in (0, 1). However, there were (at least at the time of completing the project) not a lot of results
					published regarding the model in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03218" target="_blank">two or more dimensions</a>.
					One of the possible approaches to studying the model in two dimensions
					is to consider the process on slabs - a finite number of 
					integer number lines stacked on top of each other. Throughout the summer,
					we proved that for MDLA on k slabs, the process will almost surely have sublinear growth for
					any μ in (0, 1/k).
