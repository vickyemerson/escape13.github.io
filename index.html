			<p>I am an undergraduate student of statistics
				at the University of Toronto. My acacdemic interests include
				molecular dynamics, statistical mechanics, and
			 	computational biology.<br><br> This summer I will be joining
				the <a href="https://ccglab-uhn.github.io/" target="_blank">Computational Cancer Genomics Group</a>
				led by Dr. Sushant Kumar at the Princess Margaret Cancer Center, where I will be working on
				machine learning models for prediction of catalytic constants.

					Throughout my first two years in university,
					I was working in the <a href="https://rauscher-group.physics.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank"
					>computational biophysics
					lab</a> led by Dr. Sarah Rauscher, where I worked on two projects:
					<br><br>
					1. An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20571" target="_blank">X-Ray crystallography experiment</a> that applied an
					electric field to a protein crystal was conducted 
					by Hekstra et al. to provide a new method of studying 
					protein function. The lab recreated that experiment <a href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(19)33711-7" target="_blank">in 
					silico</a>, using molecular dynamics - a computer simulation 
					method for analyzing the physical movements of atoms 
					and molecules, and provided extensive sampling. My goal was to understand the dynamics
					of that protein crystal, for which I deployed Markov state models - a statistical
					approach to clustering the protein's conformational ensemble into
					distinct low-energy states and calculating the probability of transition between them.

					2. Dimensionality reduction is a statistical method
					that attempts to find a more compact representation
					of data that preserves its geometry. One of the 
					popular approaches for dimensionality reduction is autoencoders - 
					feed-forward neural networks that become narrow in the middle and
					then expand again. By defining the loss function as the error
					of data reconstruction and training the network, we attempt
					to produce data of reduced dimension in the latent space - the bottleneck in the middle.
					Hern√°ndez et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08576" target="_blank">adapted this idea</a> for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations.
					<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eZEZW900nRzx1ER5JEky23MYygDEftJw/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">We verified</a> their architecture on several simple proteins and a PDZ domain.
					Additionally, we augmented the architecture of the Variational Dynamics Encoder with an Equivariant Graph Neural Network.
